# MyDrive Assembly Instructions

Follow these steps to assemble your **MyDrive** and connect it to your AirPort device.  

## What You’ll Need

- External SSD  
- USB 2.0 cable  
- Strong adhesive or glue suitable for electronics  

## Steps

1. **Attach the USB cable**  
   - Glue the USB 2.0 cable securely to the inside of the MyDrive housing. Ensure the connector is positioned so it will plug directly into your AirPort Extreme or AirPort Express.  

2. **Insert the SSD**  
   - Place the external SSD inside the bottom half of the housing. Make sure it sits flat and aligns with the USB cable.  

3. **Close the housing**  
   - Carefully push the top half of the housing onto the bottom half.  
   - Press until all edges are flush and the housing fits snugly.  

4. **Connect to AirPort**  
   - Plug the USB cable into the **USB port** on your AirPort Extreme or AirPort Express.  
   - Power on your AirPort, and your MyDrive should now be recognized as an external storage device.  

## Tips

- Double-check the USB orientation before gluing.  
- Use minimal glue to avoid interference with the SSD or cable.  
- Be gentle when closing the housing to prevent bending the cable or damaging the drive.
